The coursive font is [Firicico](https://github.com/kosimst/Firicico), if you dont like it and just want the cool looking operators, install [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

## Usage

Copy the `.vscode` folder from one of the subfolders to you project, run `start_vscode.bat`/`start_vscode.sh`, open your project folder and install all recommentet extensions.
If you are only using one kind of project, you can also use the `start_vscode.bat`/`start_vscode.sh` from the subfolders or make a shortcut to your desktop.
